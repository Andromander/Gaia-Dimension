    "1.0.0": "• Gaia Dimension is officially released. This is the first version.",
    "1.0.1": "+ Added a config option for sky settings. If you turn them off, but you don't want the bland yellow skies and pink clouds, you can switch them out for another setting. These settings are preset from existing biomes.\n + Added Foggy Glass. Smelt some Salt for pristine white windows\n + Added Cloudy Glass. Can be made from Cloudy Shards.\n • Green Agate trees now check more ground to grow from. Too little space will result in no growth.\n • Due to the new generation checks, Green Agate Jungles allow for more trees to generate.\n • Fluids now mix together properly. They used to not mix at all, resulting in weird fluid behavior.\n • Fixed Gold Fire in general. CodeChickenLib spammed a tesselating block error, and some entities caused the world to crash when near this block.\n • Fixed some texture renders if ConnectedTexturesMod isn't loaded. Warned you all.\n • Rearranged the configuration file options. I would advise clearing the current config.\n • Fixed dedicated servers crashing in two places thanks to missing sided annotations.\n - Removed Dimension Seed config. Doesn't seem to work as nicely as expected.\n - Removed random config option that did nothing and was a copy-paste error.",
    "1.0.2": "+ Added Pebbles. May drop Sturdy Pebbles.\n + Added Sturdy Pebbles. Can be thrown to deal a bit of damage.\n + Added Agate Arrow.

Can store quarter stacks of gemstones exclusive to Gaia.\n + Added Scaynyx Bucket. Can hold all fluids like a standard Bucket.\n + Added JEI Compat. Supports Restructurer and Purifier recipes, and shows burn times for each Tile Entity as averages.\n • Primal Beasts now spawn. They shall rise from the Superhot Magma underground, and maybe the land.\n • Blue Howlite Wolves now spawn in the Blue Agate Taiga. Rare, but dangerous.\n • Eating Geode Slices now gives you Agate Fabric • Consuming any Geode juices now gives you a short burst of a Potion effect. Can also be consumed at any time, even when you are not hungry.\n • Salt will now be mined at different speeds based on what tool you have.\n • Smelting Redstone and Lapis Lazuli now gives you exp.\n • Increased exp gained from smelting for Scaynyx.\n • Altered Map Colors for various blocks.

Crafting recipes seem to glaze over me.\n • Fixed alternative crafting for Reinforced Bricks still checking for Gaia Stone Bricks metadata.\n • Fixed some blocks using CTM not properly rendering.\n • Fixed player marker on Maps spinning if the dimension uses a negative number for an ID.\n • Fixed some en_us entries.",
    "1.0.3": "• Fixed incorrect crafting recipe for Scaynyx Bucket.",
    "1.0.4": "+ New biomes: Smoldering Bog, Shining Grove.\n + New blocks: Boggy Soil, Light Soil, Murky Grass, Soft Grass, Aura Crystal Growth, Aura Shoot, Aura Log, Aura Leaves, Aura Planks, Aura Plank Slab, Aura Plank Stairs, Sparkling Rock, Impure Sludge, Impure Rock, Active Rock, Geyser Vent.\n + New items: Tilipi, Tilibl, Tiligr, Tilipu, Tiliol, Tilimy, Tiliou, Plagued Tiliey.\n + New mobs: Bismuth Uletrus.\n + New fluids: Liquid Bismuth, Liquid Aura.\n + Added Corrupt Mania effect. Damages you over time, but gives you a damage boost. Attacks from Corrupt mobs will deal additional damage.\n   + Eating Plagued Tiliey will afflict Corrupt Mania.\n + New particles for Pyrite Torch, Gaia Portal, Restructurer, and Purifier.\n • Optimised how sky colours are determined.\n • Retextured the Ancient Lagrahk and Nomadic Lagrahk.\n • Biomes got a bit bigger than last time. Note that this change will only happen in new chunks or dimensions.\n • Corrupted Growth Sappers and Contorted Nagas can now afflict Corrupt Mania.\n • Absolutely positively disabled rain in Gaia.\n • Bonemeal can now be applied to Glitter Grass, Corrupt Grass, and Soft Grass. Murky Grass does not have any effect.\n • Made Rugged Lurmorus, Ancient Lagrahk, and Nomadic Lagrahk faster.\n • Attempted to make Archaic Warriors slower.\n • General code cleanups.\n • Fixed Slabs not dropping properly if they were double-stacked.\n • Mining certain ores now drop experience orbs.",

  "1.14.4": {
    "1.1.0": "Gaia Dimension is now out for 1.14.4! In celebration, there's some new features not present in 1.0.5. First, there are now Stripped Logs, Wood, and Stripped Wood of all Agate Logs. Then, there's now a config option to let the portal be created anywhere, not just Hot, Dry, or Mountain biomes. Lastly, the option to change dimension ID has been removed, as these are now automatically assigned by Forge. Along with this, all Ore Dictionary entries have been removed in exchange for Tags. Some entries still exist, but most have been removed due to lack of use (if you wish to have blocks or items in tags by default in Minecraft or Forge, let me know via GitHub or Discord).",
    "1.1.1": "• Gave plants the ability to be potted, barring Crystal Growths. Now you can have a little Gaia in your home.\n • Planks are now Tiles. This makes sense because you are making these from stone trees after all.\n • Fixed errors in one of the Tags. Not sure how this got through, it does print an error in the log.\n • Fixed a crash that would occur if another mod or config errors. This is more of a patch on another issue than a fix.\n • Fixed portal particles being way too big in size. Nope, wasn't a feature.\n • Block Loot Tables are now generated. This doesn't affect anything for the user.",
    "1.1.2": "+ Added more Tags. Now certain items can now be compatible with each other in mods.\n • Fixed some loot table issues with some items inadvertently becoming unobtainable, those being Hot Dust, Goldstone Dust, and Fine Dust. This has now been corrected.\n • Generated more things. Most Blockstates, Block Models, Item Models, and Recipes are now generated.",
    "1.1.3": "Hotfix version for teleporting into the dimension. Apparently telling your users a certain feature has been fundamentally changed or having bugs reported are hard tasks, but then setting up a second environment just to rename a file and make another jar is hard, so fair's fair."
  },
  "1.15.2": {
    "1.2.0": "Gaia Dimension is now out for 1.15.2! No new features have been implemented, however some features have been omitted due to changes introduced in 1.15. Namely speaking, sky rendering has been altered, so stars that appeared in Purple Agate skies no longer render, clouds are white instead of being coloured per biome, and skies don't smoothly change colour. There may be some other bugs, however it is in a playable state, so feel free to test it out and report any issues.",
    "1.2.1": "Introducing the Malachite Update. This update adds in a long-awaited feature that has been waiting to be implemented since the start.\n + Add Amethyst, Copal, Jade, and Jet. They generate in raw clusters but can be made into bricks.\n + Add Gaia Mini Towers. These abandoned structures come in 4 types, and generate in all Agate biomes, Crystal Plains, and Fossil Woodlands.\n + Add some more Malachite Brick Stairs and Slabs.\n + Add Malachite Watchtower. These large towers vary in height and generate in Green Agate Jungles, Pink Agate Forests, and Crystal Plains.\n + The Malachite Guard is vastly improved and implemented. Has 3 phases, various defences, and drops Malachite tools.\n + Malachite Guard armor and Malachite Guard Baton are officially implemented.\n • Gave the Malachite Bricks some crafting recipes now that they are obtainable.\n • Pulsing Malachite Bricks are now emissive. Glow in the dark fanciness.\n • Fixed infinite resource duplication via incorrect recipe output.\n • Fixed small_flowers Tag having an extra comma.\n - Removed supports_beacon Tag. Blocks that were in the Tag now natively support Beacons.",
    "1.2.2": "Just a quick update.\n • Tweaked some entity spawning logic. This means that some entities will now spawn from Spawners and the logic for where entities are allowed to spawn is less restrictive.\n • Impure Sludge now allows for Bismuth Uletrus to spawn on naturally.\n • Brought back the stars in Purple Agate skies.\n - Removed the Moon. Did you ever notice there was a Moon?",
    "1.2.3": "I made a breakthrough, so here's a surprise update.\n • Fixed Malachite Watchtowers sometimes looking terribly broken. Hopefully now, these towers should be mostly fixed, though this will only apply to new towers."
  },
  "1.16.4": {
    "1.3.0": "Gaia Dimension is now out for 1.16.4! With all the changes that happened, there are a few changes that have been made. First, as biomes are now fully customisable, the option to toggle sky transitions is now removed. This also means preset options for sky colours are also gone. However, there is a new option: displaying stars in biomes of your choice, an example is already given to you. Next: teleporting to and from Gaia should no longer have much issue, all thanks to some refined teleporting logic. Finally, the fix to Malachite Watchtowers has also been implemented here. While it looked like this should have just come from the last update, it actually happened while I was porting, so have fun with that. There may also be a few bug fixes around the place, such as all contents in a Mega Storage Crate are now seen for the tooltip, and Aura Shoots drop if the ground is invalid for placement.\n If any bugs occur, please report them to the Gaia Dimension issue tracker.",
    "1.3.1": "IMPORTANT: Please read the disclaimer at the end of the changelog regarding biome displacement.\n + Added Russian translation. Credit to GitHub user DrHesperusModoVestnic.\n • Implemented the only possible workaround for shifting biomes. Please read the end of the changelog for more information.\n • Bring back the BiomeDictionary tags and make the portal check for those tags again.\n • Fix portals not remembering their links on restarting the game.\n • Fix possible crashes regarding plants growing on all Gaia grass.\n • Fix tool and weapon items having the wrong holding model.\n • Fix messages in the log regarding JSON objects not being as such. Please BACK UP YOUR WORLDS before playing as new chunks may generate differently.\n ",
    "1.3.2": "+ Added Advancements. These include tasks such as collecting all of a specific item or for progressing through the mod. More to come over time.\n + Added a new item: Crystal Shard. These drop from various Crystal Growth and can be used to craft Crusted Brick blocks.\n + Added a recipe that turns Shiny Bones into Bone Meal, for convenience.\n + Added en_gb and en_au translations. They are barely different from each other, but they are both different to en_us.\n • Absolutely fixed seeds rerolling in the dimension. Gaia should no longer cut off randomly each time the game is loaded.\n • Should have fixed a memory leak in the dimension that could persist outside.\n • Made some worldgen registration a little safer (credit to TelepathicGrunt for the PR).\n • Fixed various spelling mistakes in the en_us translation. Some are just for consistency, others are legitimate errors.\n • Hopefully fixed an issue with ConfiguredFeatures not appearing as registered. Fix is partly work-in-progress until it is automatically done, but it should be fine for now.\n • Fixed the pack version. Should no longer warn of being for an older version of Minecraft.\n • Fixed an odd quirk with Restructurer and Purifier's sided capabilities.\n - Removed a feature from Shimmering Grove. This feature wouldn't generate anyway, but it should not have been there. Beware of any chunk distortions."
