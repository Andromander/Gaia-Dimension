These settings are preset from existing biomes.\n + Added Foggy Glass. Smelt some Salt for pristine white windows\n + Added Cloudy Glass. Can be made from Cloudy Shards.\n • Green Agate trees now check more ground to grow from. Too little space will result in no growth.\n • Due to the new generation checks, Green Agate Jungles allow for more trees to generate.\n • Fluids now mix together properly. They used to not mix at all, resulting in weird fluid behavior.\n • Fixed Gold Fire in general. CodeChickenLib spammed a tesselating block error, and some entities caused the world to crash when near this block.\n • Fixed some texture renders if ConnectedTexturesMod isn't loaded. Warned you all.\n • Rearranged the configuration file options. I would advise clearing the current config.\n • Fixed dedicated servers crashing in two places thanks to missing sided annotations.\n - Removed Dimension Seed config.

Can store quarter stacks of gemstones exclusive to Gaia.\n + Added Scaynyx Bucket. Can hold all fluids like a standard Bucket.\n + Added JEI Compat. Supports Restructurer and Purifier recipes, and shows burn times for each Tile Entity as averages.\n • Primal Beasts now spawn. They shall rise from the Superhot Magma underground, and maybe the land.\n • Blue Howlite Wolves now spawn in the Blue Agate Taiga. Rare, but dangerous.\n • Eating Geode Slices now gives you Agate Fabric • Consuming any Geode juices now gives you a short burst of a Potion effect. Can also be consumed at any time, even when you are not hungry.\n • Salt will now be mined at different speeds based on what tool you have.\n • Smelting Redstone and Lapis Lazuli now gives you exp.\n • Increased exp gained from smelting for Scaynyx.\n • Altered Map Colors for various blocks.

Note that this change will only happen in new chunks or dimensions.\n • Corrupted Growth Sappers and Contorted Nagas can now afflict Corrupt Mania.\n • Absolutely positively disabled rain in Gaia.\n • Bonemeal can now be applied to Glitter Grass, Corrupt Grass, and Soft Grass.

  "1.14.4": {
    "1.1.0": "Gaia Dimension is now out for 1.14.4! In celebration, there's some new features not present in 1.0.5. First, there are now Stripped Logs, Wood, and Stripped Wood of all Agate Logs. Then, there's now a config option to let the portal be created anywhere, not just Hot, Dry, or Mountain biomes. Lastly, the option to change dimension ID has been removed, as these are now automatically assigned by Forge. Along with this, all Ore Dictionary entries have been removed in exchange for Tags. Some entries still exist, but most have been removed due to lack of use (if you wish to have blocks or items in tags by default in Minecraft or Forge, let me know via GitHub or Discord).",
    "1.1.1": "• Gave plants the ability to be potted, barring Crystal Growths. Now you can have a little Gaia in your home.\n • Planks are now Tiles. This makes sense because you are making these from stone trees after all.\n • Fixed errors in one of the Tags. Not sure how this got through, it does print an error in the log.\n • Fixed a crash that would occur if another mod or config errors. This is more of a patch on another issue than a fix.\n • Fixed portal particles being way too big in size. Nope, wasn't a feature.\n • Block Loot Tables are now generated. This doesn't affect anything for the user.",
    "1.1.2": "+ Added more Tags. Now certain items can now be compatible with each other in mods.\n • Fixed some loot table issues with some items inadvertently becoming unobtainable, those being Hot Dust, Goldstone Dust, and Fine Dust. This has now been corrected.\n • Generated more things. Most Blockstates, Block Models, Item Models, and Recipes are now generated.",
    "1.1.3": "Hotfix version for teleporting into the dimension. Apparently telling your users a certain feature has been fundamentally changed or having bugs reported are hard tasks, but then setting up a second environment just to rename a file and make another jar is hard, so fair's fair."
  },
  "1.15.2": {
    "1.2.0": "Gaia Dimension is now out for 1.15.2! No new features have been implemented, however some features have been omitted due to changes introduced in 1.15. Namely speaking, sky rendering has been altered, so stars that appeared in Purple Agate skies no longer render, clouds are white instead of being coloured per biome, and skies don't smoothly change colour. There may be some other bugs, however it is in a playable state, so feel free to test it out and report any issues.",
    "1.2.1": "Introducing the Malachite Update. This update adds in a long-awaited feature that has been waiting to be implemented since the start.\n + Add Amethyst, Copal, Jade, and Jet. They generate in raw clusters but can be made into bricks.\n + Add Gaia Mini Towers. These abandoned structures come in 4 types, and generate in all Agate biomes, Crystal Plains, and Fossil Woodlands.\n + Add some more Malachite Brick Stairs and Slabs.\n + Add Malachite Watchtower. These large towers vary in height and generate in Green Agate Jungles, Pink Agate Forests, and Crystal Plains.\n + The Malachite Guard is vastly improved and implemented. Has 3 phases, various defences, and drops Malachite tools.\n + Malachite Guard armor and Malachite Guard Baton are officially implemented.\n • Gave the Malachite Bricks some crafting recipes now that they are obtainable.\n • Pulsing Malachite Bricks are now emissive. Glow in the dark fanciness.\n • Fixed infinite resource duplication via incorrect recipe output.\n • Fixed small_flowers Tag having an extra comma.\n - Removed supports_beacon Tag. Blocks that were in the Tag now natively support Beacons.",
    "1.2.2": "Just a quick update.\n • Tweaked some entity spawning logic. This means that some entities will now spawn from Spawners and the logic for where entities are allowed to spawn is less restrictive.\n • Impure Sludge now allows for Bismuth Uletrus to spawn on naturally.\n • Brought back the stars in Purple Agate skies.\n - Removed the Moon. Did you ever notice there was a Moon?",
    "1.2.3": "I made a breakthrough, so here's a surprise update.•  Fixed Malachite Watchtowers sometimes looking terribly broken. Hopefully now, these towers should be mostly fixed, though this will only apply to new towers.",
    "1.2.4": "Just a bugfix for a potential memory leak. Don't get too comfy with the new update, unless this was why it was difficult to play."
  },
  "1.16.4": {
    "1.3.0": "Gaia Dimension is now out for 1.16.4! With all the changes that happened, there are a few changes that have been made. First, as biomes are now fully customisable, the option to toggle sky transitions is now removed. This also means preset options for sky colours are also gone. However, there is a new option: displaying stars in biomes of your choice, an example is already given to you. Next: teleporting to and from Gaia should no longer have much issue, all thanks to some refined teleporting logic. Finally, the fix to Malachite Watchtowers has also been implemented here. While it looked like this should have just come from the last update, it actually happened while I was porting, so have fun with that. There may also be a few bug fixes around the place, such as all contents in a Mega Storage Crate are now seen for the tooltip, and Aura Shoots drop if the ground is invalid for placement.\n If any bugs occur, please report them to the Gaia Dimension issue tracker.",
    "1.3.1": "IMPORTANT: Please read the disclaimer at the end of the changelog regarding biome displacement.\n + Added Russian translation. Credit to GitHub user DrHesperusModoVestnic.\n • Implemented the only possible workaround for shifting biomes. Please read the end of the changelog for more information.\n • Bring back the BiomeDictionary tags and make the portal check for those tags again.\n • Fix portals not remembering their links on restarting the game.\n • Fix possible crashes regarding plants growing on all Gaia grass.\n • Fix tool and weapon items having the wrong holding model.\n • Fix messages in the log regarding JSON objects not being as such. Please BACK UP YOUR WORLDS before playing as new chunks may generate differently.\n ",
    "1.3.2": "+ Added Advancements. These include tasks such as collecting all of a specific item or for progressing through the mod. More to come over time.\n + Added a new item: Crystal Shard. These drop from various Crystal Growth and can be used to craft Crusted Brick blocks.\n + Added a recipe that turns Shiny Bones into Bone Meal, for convenience.\n + Added en_gb and en_au translations. They are barely different from each other, but they are both different to en_us.\n • Absolutely fixed seeds rerolling in the dimension. Gaia should no longer cut off randomly each time the game is loaded.\n • Should have fixed a memory leak in the dimension that could persist outside.\n • Made some worldgen registration a little safer (credit to TelepathicGrunt for the PR).\n • Fixed various spelling mistakes in the en_us translation. Some are just for consistency, others are legitimate errors.\n • Hopefully fixed an issue with ConfiguredFeatures not appearing as registered. Fix is partly work-in-progress until it is automatically done, but it should be fine for now.\n • Fixed the pack version. Should no longer warn of being for an older version of Minecraft.\n • Fixed an odd quirk with Restructurer and Purifier's sided capabilities.\n - Removed a feature from Shimmering Grove. This feature wouldn't generate anyway, but it should not have been there. Beware of any chunk distortions.",
    "1.3.3": "• Portal configuration has gone under some renovations.\n   • Config has moved from Server to Common. Now it should be located in the config folder.\n  • The dimension the portal may form to Gaia is now configurable.\n  • Biome checking can now exclude or include biomes from portal creation.\n  • Biome conditions are now based on either the Biome, Category, or Type.\n • Malachite Guard has gone though some changes and is better than ever.\n  • Stomp attack. Get a bit too close, and it shall strike around itself with a stomping attack.\n  • Blast attack. Hiding? Trying for the higher ground? It will strike everyone down with a powerful blast. Be careful: it does not forget the pain.\n  • No longer drowns. In fact, the Malachite Guard can no longer drown and can walk through fluids without problem.\n  • Step height his now much greater.\n  • Falling from a great height means nothing to the Malachite Guard.\n  • Targets are now determined properly. Anything distracting is now ignored.\n  • Boats are no longer enticing. Better luck next time with the cruise trip\n • Malachite Drones are now more aware of their connection. If they can't return, they will stop following the Guard. They will also not despawn if they are a follower.\n • Various Tags have been added or modified\n • Fix structure names not being properly set.\n • Fix Old Bows not using Infinite enchantment\n • Textures for entities and armour have been moved and renamed. In case you have a resource pack, this may be important\n • Some Advancements are now more rewarding for completing them\n • Change how logs are stripped. This should fix mods using non-Axe items for stripping.\n • Mappings have been changed. This does not affect you, however there may be some new unintended bugs.\n • Cavern Ticks, Mineral Arenthis, and Shallow Arenthis no longer have \"noisy\" movement\n • Create subtitles for various entities\n • Stopped log spam due to unknown recipe type\n • Fixed portals forming inproperly under certain conditions\n • CTM compat has officially returned.\n • Dispensers now treat Scaynyx Buckets as such.

    "2.0.79": "For thousands of years I lay dormant. Now, Gaia Dimension's slumber has been disturbed for 1.19.4! This might be a little buggy while ironing out all the changes between then and now.

As such, worlds may not be compatible with each other.\n + Added Mookaite Mesa, a marbled expanse of jasper.\n + Added Mookaite Construct, an entity cobbled with various parts of Mookaite.\n + Added Opalite Construct, a stout entity made of a special glass resembling opal.\n + Added 6 colours of Mookaite: Scarlet, Auburn, Gold, Mauve, Beige, and Ivory.\n + Added a WIP item, Construct Charm.

Below 0 becomes all Primal Mass, while even deeper becomes Nexustone. Watch this space, you may never know what lurks in the dreaded depths.\n • Biome layout has been reworked to allow for a rare island of Golden biomes. Mineral Reservoirs are now more expansive than before.\n • Modified some fluid mixing interactions, allowing for more blocks obtainable through mixing.\n • Several blocks have been renamed in the registry.

These come in six varieties of colour to match each Mookaite block.\n + Added Opalite, a crystal found only in Mookaite Mesa.\n + Added a new tag for Mookaite blocks.\n • Retextured Mookaite blocks.

    "2.1.139": "NOTE: While the maximum Forge version has been unlocked, I would highly recommend using NeoForge for stability.\n + A new gemstone has appeared: Celestine. These are found deep within Gaia.\n + Added Block of Opalite. Forgot to add this when adding Opalite.\n + Added Construct Kits. These come in Blank, Repair, Augment, and Replace.\n  • A Blank Kit is a template to craft into the other Kits.\n  • A Repair Kit turns a coloured Mookaite part into an Opalite part.\n  • An Augment Kit adds a part where it was empty.\n  • A Replace Kit turns any part into a different colour of Mookaite.\n + Added mounds to the Mookaite Mesa.\n • Ixiolite has been renamed to Stibnite.\n • Leucite has been renamed to Albite.\n • Chalcedony has been renamed to Goshenite.\n • Mookaite Construct and Opalite Construct have fully implemented interactions:\n  • First, a Mookaite Construct and Opalite Construct may be bonded. To do this, use a Construct Charm on the desired two and they'll be bonded. It's that easy. A bond will also enable a wide array of entity AI for the Mookaite Construct:\n   • Parts affect various stats on a Mookaite Construct. Horns affect knockback resistance, Eyes affect Armor, Shoulders affect knockback amount, Arms affect damage, and Legs affect speed.\n  • If a part is missing, the respective stat for the part is degraded.\n   • If a part is Scarlet, it will enable a shockwave attack, with more of the same colour allowing a wider range.\n   • If a part is Auburn, it will enable a fire breath attack, with more of the same colour allowing for a longer duration.\n   • If a part is Gold, it will enable a magic cloud area attack, with more of the same colour allowing the area to linger longer.\n   • If a part is Mauve, it will enable an electric force field attack, with more of the same colour keeping the field up longer.\n   • If a part is Beige, it will let the Mookaite Construct heal itself when out of combat, with more of the same colour healing more frequently.\n   • If a part is Ivory, it will enable a projectile attack, with more of the same colour shooting more projectiles.\n   • Mookaite Constructs made up of all the same colour gain a bonus damage immunity. Scarlet is explosion immune, Auburn is fire immune, Gold is magic immune, Mauve is electric immune, Beige is freeze immune, and Ivory is projectile immune.\n   • If a part is Opalite, it will bolster the respective stat of the part.\n  • Opalite Constructs can also be given materials in the form of Mookaite and Opalite, and if given a Construct Kit with the right materials, they can perform maintenance on the Mookaite Construct.\n   • Repairing requires 10 Opalite.\n   • Augmenting requires 5 Opalite and 10 of a single colour of Mookaite.\n   • Replacing requires 5 of a single colour of Mookaite.\n • Mookaite Mesa bands have been adjusted to balance rarity of each colour.\n • Fixed the remapper not adjusting renamed objects properly.
